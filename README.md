# VeinCV
## Motivation
Peripheral difficult venous access problem (PDVA), which is characterized by non-visible and non-palpable veins where a highly experienced operator is required with the use of technological aids to insert a vascular device. Besides requiring the extra labor, material costs, and insurance claims, the repeated punctures also lead to damage to the veins and cause significant discomfort to the patients. Frequent complications: thin veins, fatty deposits, skin color, chronic, puncture damage, hairy skin.
